# Task 1: Telegram exporter

## Explains the approach:

*** 

* **Why this stack?**

Having checked the available technologies for working with telegrams, I decided to work with the "Telethon", since there are all the necessary stack technologies for this.

* **Why such an approach?**

While I was writing this code,
While I was writing this code, I tried to adhere to the prerequisites **"Readability of the code + the ability for the user to change certain values in the code without programming knowledge."**
So I moved everything to a config file where the user can set certain conditions without reusing or changing the code


* **How much time did you spend on the project**
 
With analyzing the available technologies, read documentations/videos creating the structure code, fixing bugs and creating .md file **I have spent around 15 hours**
